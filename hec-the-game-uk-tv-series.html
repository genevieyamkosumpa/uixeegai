I tried to get all the responses into the body of this post. I apologize if I missed a few, but there were a lot. I'll still be updating the notable Sequence links until the sitewide event. My biggest takeaway from S8E1 is that the show runners are really trying to foreshadow a tragic conflict between Dany and Jon. This conflict has seeds that have been sown brilliantly on many fronts in S8E1 and also in a few scenes in previous seasons. I’m going to outline how various characters in the story are going to foment this fissure and ultimately bring on a conflict between Dany and Jon that will end the series. Tyrion and Varys: Right now, these two are two of Dany’s top advisors. ## Game Information Game Title : Days Gone (https://gfycat.com/carelessunsungasiaticmouflon) Genre : Action-adventure, survival-horror, zombies, post-apocalyptic, open world, Sam Witwer Platforms : PlayStation 4 Media : E3 2016 Announce Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n95IaELdWDU) Gameplay Demo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGej8K1r8KI) E3 2017 Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SnXOtfN7VQ) Alternate Playthrough (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm.

This isn’t a prediction—I’m done making predictions. It’s just what I want, my ideal ending. I’ve been a fan of Gendry for a long time—since S1, when he stood up for Arya when he didn’t have to—but tbh I never actually thought he’d have a shot at the crown. He was a bastard, and bastards are entitled to nothing. Then Dany legitimized him, and the math changed. ___ ##A Baratheon on the Throne Gendry now has two separate paths to the throne: ##1.

I keep seeing comments about the lack of chemistry between Jon and Dany. Clearly, in the past couple of episodes, they have had very good reasons for feeling a little awkward around one another--and I highly doubt things are going to be heating up between them in the finale, unless it's literally. But part of the problem for a lot of viewers is that the stakes feel very low because there's no real foundation for their relationship.
