Johnny Deed has a highly significant personality that any young adult attires as his style. My Dad asked for a book for Christmas but he can barely remember a thing about it. He says the author's name sounds like "Bueno Fieri" and that the protagonist is called "Malachi" perhaps, or something similar. It's a detective book and the author has since passed, having only written 2 books.
